4. Enter any humidity when the console says '습도를 입력하세요:' means 'Enter humidity' (between 0 and 80)
5. The following graph is the result of rule evaluation by Mamdani inference. Check it and close the window.
6. The next following graph shows the center-of-graity with black solid lines as a result of applying the center-of-graity method. Check it and close the window.
7. Check the results of the '에어컨을 x% 출력합니다.' means 'x% output of the air conditioner' on the console.
